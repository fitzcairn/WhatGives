WhatGives
=========

This is the source for the WhatGives WoW addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/whatgives).  Please see Curse for a more complete description of the addon; the below has been copied from there.

If you've ever spent time poring over tooltips in your character screen trying to find how in the world you have X% of some stat, this is the mod for you.

Using WhatGives

This addon is very simple. Open your character screen with the mod enabled. You will see a new dropdown at the botton of the screen. The dropdown contains all the statistics and slot types awarded by your gear. If you want to see which of your gear has Hit, for example, select "Hit Rating" from the dropdown menu. All your gear that awards Hit Rating will now be highlighted.

There are a few slash commands available. To hide WhatGives in the character window, use /wg hide. Likewise, to show it: /wg show. For a list of all commands, type /wg or /wg help.

Does WhatGives Handle Reforging/Gemming/Enchanting/Set Bonuses/Etc?

Yes. The addon works by scanning your equipment every time you open your character screen. It captures all stats awarded by gear, including set bonuses and reforging.

Is WhatGives Available in My Language?

Yes and no. The stats use Blizzard's localization, and should display/parse correctly in any language (caveat: not tested). However, the few addon-specific strings are only in English at the moment. Hit me up if you're interested in translating!

Cool! But I Want WhatGives to ALSO do X/Y/Z....

I'm happy to add features if you have ideas for expansion, and have a few ideas myself if the addon takes off. Reply in the comments or open a ticket. Also, feel free to hack it yourself.
